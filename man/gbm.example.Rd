\title{Glioblastoma (GBM) Example Dataset}
\format{
An object with 9 different sets of GBM data needed to run the MOMA analysis
\describe{
\item{vipermat}{matrix of viper scores with samples in columns and regulators
 across the rows}
\item{cindy}{list of regulators, each with a set of modulators and p values
representing their CINDY inferred association}
\item{preppi}{list of regulators, each with a set of potential binding
partners and PREPPi inferred p values for probability of binding}
\item{rawsnp}{matrix of samples and genes with potential mutations.
0 for no mutation, 1 for presence of some non-silent mutation}
\item{rawcnv}{matrix of samples and genes with copy number variant scores
calculated by GISTIC}
\item{fusions}{matrix of samples and fusion genes.
0 for no fusion, 1 for presence of fusion}
\item{gene.loc.mapping}{dataframe with 4 columns, Gene Symbol, Locus ID,
Cytoband location, Entrez ID. Used for mapping amplifications and deletions
between gene and location}
\item{clinical}{dataframe of clinical annotations, taken directly from TCGA}
\item{fCNV}{vector of gene names that have functional CNV mutations}
\item{mutSig}{blacklist of genes to not use in the DIGGIT analysis}
